I created this project using HTML and CSS files. This is a news website, deriving news articles from BBC.com. The highlight of this project is the pure css parallax effect I have used using ztransform. I have defined the widths of all the divisions using % instead of pixels, hence mimicking what the grid 960 system does. I have also used a custom single css file for bothe the webpages created.
